# IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection

[IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection) challenge was first hosted 
by [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) in 2019. The idea was for competitors to develop a model to detect fraud from customer
transactions. While [IEEE-CIS](https://cis.ieee.org/) already have a fraud prevention system in place, researchers were
looking for ways to improve the current figure being saved by the system, and improve the customer experience.
